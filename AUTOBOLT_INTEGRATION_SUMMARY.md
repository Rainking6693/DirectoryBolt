- Job management methods (getNextJob, updateJobProgress, completeJob)

**Enhanced**: `pages/api/autobolt/heartbeat.ts`
- Added GET support for connection testing
- Proper AUTOBOLT_API_KEY authentication
- Both heartbeat updates and connection validation

### 2. Job Queue Processing Pipeline ✅

**Analyzed & Validated**: 
- `pages/api/autobolt/jobs/next.ts` - Job retrieval working correctly
- `pages/api/autobolt/jobs/update.ts` - Progress updates implemented
- `pages/api/autobolt/jobs/complete.ts` - Job completion handling

**Key Features**:
- Proper status transitions (queued → processing → completed)
- Progress tracking with directory results
- Error handling and retry logic
- Customer status synchronization

### 3. Audit Trail & Directory Submission Tracking ✅

**Created**: `pages/api/autobolt/audit-trail.ts`
- Complete audit trail for directory submissions
- Tracks which directories customers were submitted to
- Submission status, timestamps, and results
- Processing time and performance metrics
- Filterable by job ID or customer ID

### 4. Real-Time Progress Tracking ✅

**Created**: `pages/api/autobolt/real-time-status.ts`
- Live monitoring of active jobs
- Extension status tracking
- Queue statistics and performance metrics
- Progress percentages and completion estimates
- Staff dashboard integration ready

### 5. Test & Verification System ✅

**Created**: `pages/api/autobolt/test-submissions.ts`
- Create test jobs to verify directory submissions
- Monitor test progress and results
- Validate AutoBolt is actually working
- Staff testing interface

### 6. Enhanced Extension UI ✅

**Created**: `.netlify/static/autobolt-extension/popup-enhanced.js`
- Visible confirmation when customers are processed
- Real-time processing status updates
- API key configuration interface
- Success/failure notifications with toast system
- Processing metrics and current job display

### 7. Comprehensive Testing ✅

**Created**: 
- `test-autobolt-integration.js` - End-to-end API testing
- `test-endpoints-local.js` - Local validation testing

**Test Results**: All local tests passed (100% success rate)

## 🔑 API Endpoints Overview

### Extension Authentication
- `GET /api/autobolt/heartbeat` - Connection test & health check
- `GET /api/extension/validate?customerId=<id>` - Customer validation

### Job Processing  
- `GET /api/autobolt/jobs/next` - Get next job from queue
- `POST /api/autobolt/jobs/update` - Update job progress with directory results
- `POST /api/autobolt/jobs/complete` - Mark job as completed

### Monitoring & Audit
- `GET /api/autobolt/audit-trail?jobId=<id>` - Get submission audit trail
- `GET /api/autobolt/real-time-status` - Live processing status
- `POST /api/autobolt/test-submissions` - Create test job
- `GET /api/autobolt/test-submissions` - Get test status

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Extension stores API key in chrome.storage
2. DirectoryBoltAPI class handles all authenticated requests
3. All endpoints validate AUTOBOLT_API_KEY header
4. Heartbeat endpoint provides connection testing

### Job Processing Flow
1. Extension calls `/api/autobolt/jobs/next` to get work
2. Processes directories and calls `/api/autobolt/jobs/update` with results
3. Calls `/api/autobolt/jobs/complete` when finished
4. Audit trail tracks all submissions and outcomes

### Real-Time Monitoring
1. Staff dashboard calls `/api/autobolt/real-time-status` for live updates
2. Extension sends heartbeats to track connectivity
3. Progress tracking shows completion percentages and time estimates
4. Comprehensive metrics for performance monitoring

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
AUTOBOLT_API_KEY=ak_production_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
```

### Production Deployment Steps
