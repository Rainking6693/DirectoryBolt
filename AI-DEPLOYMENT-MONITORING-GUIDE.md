# 🚀 AI Services Deployment - Monitoring Guide

**Deployment Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**  
**Railway Auto-Deploy:** In Progress

---

## 📡 What to Monitor

### 1. **Railway Worker Logs** (CRITICAL)

Check Railway dashboard for these initialization messages:

```
✅ EXPECTED TO SEE:
🎼 AI Submission Orchestrator initialized
🔄 Intelligent Retry Analyzer initialized
🗺️  AI Form Mapper initialized
⏰ Submission Timing Optimizer initialized
🧪 A/B Testing Framework initialized
📈 Performance Feedback Loop initialized
🤖 Using AI Enhanced Queue Manager for job selection
```

**If you see these ✅** → AI services are active!

**If you see warnings ⚠️** → Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Railway environment variables

### 2. **During Job Processing**

Look for these log patterns:

```
✅ AI probability score computed (directory: X, score: 0.85)
✅ AI Form Mapper detected fields (fieldsDetected: 8, confidence: 0.87)
✅ Retry analysis complete (shouldRetry: true, retryProbability: 0.75)
✅ Submission recorded in feedback loop
✅ AI selected optimal job
```

### 3. **Dashboard Metrics**

Monitor these improvements over 24-48 hours:

| Metric | Before | Expected After 24h | Expected After 1 Week |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Success Rate | 40-50% | 55-65% (+20%) | 70-80% (+40%) |
| Avg Processing Time | Baseline | -30% | -50% |
| Failed Retries | High | -30% | -50% |
| New Directory Success | Low | +40% | +60% |

## 🔍 How to Verify AI is Working

### Quick Check (5 minutes):

**1. Create a Test Customer**
```
- Go to Staff Dashboard
- Click "+ Create Test Customer"
- Fill in business details
- Submit
```

**2. Watch Railway Logs**
```
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Open worker logs
- Look for AI service initialization messages
- Watch for "AI Form Mapper" and "Retry analysis" messages
```

**3. Check Submission Activity**
```
- Go to Staff Dashboard > Submission Activity
- Look for submissions with AI metadata
- Check for "AI customized" indicators
```

### Deep Check (1 hour):

**1. Monitor Success Rates**
- Track submissions over 1 hour
- Compare to historical baseline
- Look for 20-30% improvement

**2. Check AI Form Detection**
- Submit to directories without mappings
- Watch logs for "AI Form Mapper detected fields"
- Verify fields are filled correctly

**3. Test Retry Analysis**
- Wait for a few failures (natural occurrence)
- Check logs for retry recommendations
- Verify retry probability scores

## 📊 Expected AI Behavior

### Scenario 1: High-Probability Directory
```
1. AI calculates success probability: 0.85
2. Description customized for directory
3. Form fields detected (if unmapped)
4. Submission proceeds
5. Success logged in feedback loop
→ Result: Likely successful submission
```

### Scenario 2: Low-Probability Directory
```
1. AI calculates success probability: 0.45
2. Decision: Skip submission (saves time/money)
3. Logs: "Skipped by AI probability (0.45)"
→ Result: Avoided wasted submission
```

### Scenario 3: Failed Submission
```
1. Submission fails
2. Retry Analyzer analyzes failure
3. Determines: "Content quality issue, retry probability: 0.75"
4. Recommendation: Retry with improved content in 24h
5. Stored for future retry queue
→ Result: Smart retry instead of immediate re-attempt
```

### Scenario 4: Unmapped Directory
```
1. Directory has no form mapping
2. AI Form Mapper analyzes page HTML
3. Detects fields with 0.85 confidence
4. Creates mapping: { businessName: "#company-name", ... }
5. Proceeds with submission
→ Result: Successful submission without manual mapping!
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (Optional):

```bash
# AI Configuration
AI_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD=0.6  # Skip if probability < this (default: 0.6)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Required for AI services

# Queue Configuration
ENABLE_AI_PRIORITIZATION=true  # Use AI queue manager (default: true)
ENABLE_TIMING_OPTIMIZATION=true  # Use timing optimizer (default: true)

# Retry Configuration
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3  # Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
RETRY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.5  # Minimum confidence for retry (default: 0.5)

# Form Mapping
AI_FORM_MAPPING_CONFIDENCE=0.7  # Minimum confidence for AI mapping (default: 0.7)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** Add to Railway environment variables:
```
Railway Dashboard → Variables → Add Variable
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = sk-ant-your-key-here
```

### Issue: "AI services not initializing"
**Check:**
1. Railway environment variables set correctly
2. Worker redeployed after variable addition
3. No API rate limits exceeded (check Anthropic dashboard)

### Issue: "No improvement in success rate"
**Possible causes:**
1. Need 24-48 hours for statistically significant results
2. Check if AI services are actually being called (check logs)
3. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is valid

### Issue: "API costs too high"
**Solutions:**
1. Increase AI_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD to 0.7 or 0.8
2. Enable caching (already configured)
3. Review Anthropic dashboard for usage patterns
4. Consider upgrading to Claude Opus for better caching
