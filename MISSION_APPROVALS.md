Record approval state for each master checklist section. Sections (from `UPDATEDPLAN.9.14.md`):
1. Pre-Testing & Setup
2. API Endpoints
3. Dashboards & Logins
4. Extension Customer Journey
5. Critical Failures
6. Immediate Action Items
7. Urgent Agent Assignments
8. System Integrity & Recovery

Format per section:
`Section N - <title>`
`- Cora: [YES/NO] — comment — timestamp`
`- Frank: [YES/NO] — comment — timestamp`
`- Clive: [YES/NO] — comment — timestamp`
`- Blake: [YES/NO] — comment — timestamp`

Only when all four are `YES` with comments will the next section be unblocked.
