# üöÄ AutoBolt Extension-to-Backend Migration Master Project
## Complete Chrome Extension Elimination & Backend Migration

**Project Code:** AUTOBOLT-MIGRATION-2025
**Start Time:** ${new Date().toISOString()}
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Hudson Audit Required:** Every 5 minutes + task completion

---

## üéØ PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. **100% Chrome Extension Elimination** - No extension dependencies remain
2. **Complete Backend Migration** - All functionality moved to Netlify Functions + Workers
3. **Feature Parity** - Backend matches or exceeds extension capabilities
4. **Enterprise Scalability** - Proxy support, captcha solving, worker scaling
5. **Revenue Protection** - Zero disruption to customer processing flow

---

## üîí MANDATORY PROCESS REQUIREMENTS

### Critical Rules
- ‚úÖ **5-minute check-ins:** ALL agents report to Hudson every 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Hudson-only audits:** No agent proceeds without Hudson's approval
- ‚úÖ **Zero fake implementations:** Production-ready code only
- ‚úÖ **Blake end-to-end testing:** Comprehensive testing after all development
- ‚úÖ **Hudson final approval:** Final go/no-go decision

### Check-in Protocol
```
Every 5 minutes, agents must report:
1. Current task status
2. Blockers encountered
3. Code written/modified
4. Next immediate steps
5. Hudson approval needed for: [specific items]
```
