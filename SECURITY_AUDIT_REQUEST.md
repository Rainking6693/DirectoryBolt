**Date:** December 7, 2024  
**Requested by:** Emily (Security Specialist)  
**Audit Required by:** Cora (QA Auditor) & Hudson (Security Engineer)

## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY CLEANUP COMPLETED - AUDIT REQUIRED**

I have completed a comprehensive security cleanup of the DirectoryBolt codebase to remove ALL exposed API keys and credentials. However, Ben has identified that I may have missed some files, and I need your expert audit to verify complete security.

---

## üìã **AUDIT SCOPE**

### **Primary Objective:**
Verify that **ZERO** exposed API keys, tokens, or credentials remain anywhere in the codebase.

### **Files I've Cleaned:**
1. `.env.local` - Replaced all real keys with placeholders
2. `.env.production` - Replaced all real keys with placeholders  
3. `popup.js` & `popup-original.js` - Removed hardcoded Airtable tokens
4. `setup-guides/env-template.txt` - Removed real keys from template
5. Multiple documentation files - Redacted key fragments
6. Test files - Updated to use mock values

### **Search Patterns to Verify:**
- `sk-proj-*` (OpenAI keys)
- `sk_test_51*` & `sk_live_51*` (Stripe secret keys)
- `pk_test_51*` & `pk_live_51*` (Stripe publishable keys)
- `whsec_*` (Webhook secrets)
- `pat*` (Airtable personal access tokens)
- `eyJ*` (JWT tokens)

## üéØ **AUDIT REQUESTS**

### **For Cora (QA Auditor):**
Please perform a comprehensive end-to-end audit to verify:

1. **Complete File Scan:**
   - Search ALL file types (`.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.json`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.env*`, `.yaml`, `.yml`)
   - Verify no real API keys remain in ANY file
   - Check for partial key fragments that could be reconstructed

2. **Documentation Review:**
   - Verify all reports and documentation are sanitized
   - Ensure no sensitive data in commit messages or git history
   - Check that all examples use proper placeholder format

3. **Test File Validation:**
   - Confirm all test files use clearly marked mock values
   - Verify no realistic-looking test keys that could be mistaken for real ones

### **For Hudson (Security Engineer):**
Please perform a security-focused audit to verify:

1. **Deep Security Scan:**
   - Use advanced pattern matching to find any missed credentials
   - Check for encoded/obfuscated keys
   - Verify no keys in binary files or hidden directories

2. **Git History Analysis:**
   - Ensure exposed keys are not accessible in git history
   - Verify no sensitive data in previous commits
   - Check for any security vulnerabilities introduced during cleanup

3. **Environment Security:**
   - Validate that all environment files use proper placeholder format
   - Ensure no production secrets in development files
   - Verify proper separation of development and production configurations
