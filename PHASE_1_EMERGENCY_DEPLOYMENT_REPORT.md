## 📊 **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**

### **Airtable Connection Confirmed**:
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "records": 4,
  "sample_customers": [
    "DIR-NaNNaNNaN-recDVmCVzT9xRHwam",
    "DIR-202597-recwsFS91NG2O90xi"
  ]
}
```

### **Security Bypass Removed**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('⚠️ DEVELOPMENT MODE: Allowing staff access without authentication')
  return res.status(200).json({...})
}

// AFTER (SECURE):
// SECURITY FIX: Development bypass REMOVED for production security
// All authentication must go through proper channels
```

### **Extension Files Created**:
```
build/auto-bolt-extension/
├── manifest.json          ✅ (DirectoryBolt branding)  
├── customer-popup.html    ✅ (Modern UI)
└── customer-popup.js      ✅ (Enhanced validation)
```

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETION**

1. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test Customer API**: Validate `/api/customer/validate` endpoint
3. **Generate Secure Credentials**: Run `node scripts/generate-secure-credentials.js`
4. **Deploy Extension**: Load extension in Chrome for testing
5. **Run Full Tests**: Execute `node scripts/phase1-emergency-tests.js`
