# Stripe Build Fixes - Netlify Deployment Issues Resolved

## Overview
Fixed critical build errors preventing Netlify deployment related to Stripe API routes being treated as static pages during Next.js static generation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Error #31 - Static Generation of API Routes
**Problem**: API routes in `/pages/api/` were being statically generated during build, causing `t.status is not a function` and `t.setHeader is not a function` errors.

**Solution**: 
- Added build-time safety checks to all API route handlers
- Implemented `isBuildTimeSafe()` checks in API routes
- API routes now return `{ notFound: true }` during build time
- Added safe header setting with try/catch blocks

### 2. Stripe Environment Variables Handling
**Problem**: Missing or invalid Stripe environment variables during build time causing initialization failures.

**Solution**:
- Updated `stripe-environment-validator.ts` to handle build-time scenarios
- Added support for `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` as alternative to `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID`
- Improved build-time detection (CI, Netlify, BUILDING flags)
- Added placeholder configurations for build environments

### 3. Build Configuration Improvements
**Problem**: Next.js configuration not properly excluding API routes from static generation.

**Solution**:
- Updated `next.config.js` with `output: 'standalone'` 
- Added build-time environment variables
- Improved webpack configuration for better Node.js compatibility
- Added outputFileTracingExcludes for optimization

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration Files
- `next.config.js` - Enhanced build configuration
- `package.json` - Added cross-env dependency and build scripts
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify-specific configuration
- `.env.example` - Updated with build-time documentation

### Stripe Integration Files
- `lib/utils/stripe-environment-validator.ts` - Enhanced build-time safety
- `pages/api/create-checkout-session.js` - Added build-time protection
- `pages/api/subscription-status.js` - Added build-time protection  
- `pages/api/payments/create-checkout.ts` - Added build-time protection
- `pages/api/payments/webhook.ts` - Added build-time protection

### Utility Files
- `lib/utils/api-build-safety.ts` - New utility for API build-time protection

### Basic API Routes
- `pages/api/health.js` - Added build-time safety

## Key Features of the Fixes

### 1. Build-Time Safety Pattern
```javascript
// Prevent execution during build time - Next.js static generation fix
if (!req || !res || typeof res.status !== 'function') {
  console.warn('API route called during build time - skipping execution');
  return { notFound: true };
}
```

### 2. Safe Header Setting
```javascript
try {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Unable to set headers during build time:', error.message);
  return { notFound: true };
}
```

### 3. Environment Detection
```javascript
export function isBuildEnvironment(): boolean {
  return !!(
    process.env.CI ||
    process.env.NETLIFY ||
    process.env.BUILDING ||
    process.env.BUILD_MODE ||
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ||
    typeof window !== 'undefined'
  );
}
```

### 4. Lazy Stripe Initialization
```javascript
function initializeStripeComponents() {
  if (!stripe || !config) {
    try {
      stripe = getStripeClient()
      config = getStripeConfig()
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Stripe initialization failed:', error.message)
      // Return defaults for build time
      stripe = null
      config = { nextAuthUrl: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000' }
    }
  }
  return { stripe, config }
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Required for Production
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key (sk_live_* for production)
- `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID` - Starter plan price ID
- `STRIPE_GROWTH_PRICE_ID` - Growth plan price ID  
- `STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRICE_ID` - Professional plan price ID
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your application URL

### Optional (Choose One)
- `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID` - Enterprise plan price ID
- `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` - Monthly subscription price ID

### Optional but Recommended
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook signature verification
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For client-side integration

## Build Commands

### Local Development
```bash
npm run build
```

### Netlify Build
```bash
npm run build:netlify
```

The build commands automatically set the required environment variables:
- `BUILDING=true` - Enables build-time safety mode
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Sets production environment
- `NETLIFY=true` - (Netlify builds only) Enables Netlify-specific optimizations

## Verification

### Build Success Indicators
1. All API routes show as `ƒ (Dynamic)` in build output
2. No "React error #31" messages
3. No "t.status is not a function" errors
4. Successful static page generation completion
5. Next-sitemap generation succeeds

### Expected Build Output
```
Route (pages)                             Size     First Load JS
...
├ ƒ /api/create-checkout-session          0 B            81.5 kB
├ ƒ /api/subscription-status              0 B            81.5 kB
├ ƒ /api/payments/create-checkout         0 B            81.5 kB
├ ƒ /api/payments/webhook                 0 B            81.5 kB
...

ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

## Deployment Notes

### Netlify Configuration
1. Set build command to: `npm run build:netlify`
2. Set publish directory to: `.next`
3. Add required environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. The `netlify.toml` file will be automatically used

### Environment Variables Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to create your environment configuration
2. Fill in actual Stripe keys and price IDs
3. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your deployed domain
4. Configure webhook endpoints in Stripe dashboard

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test build locally
npm run build

# If successful, test dev mode
npm run dev
```

### Build-Time Safety Verification
The build should complete without errors and show:
- No React error #31 messages
- All API routes marked as `ƒ (Dynamic)`
- Successful static page generation
- No Stripe-related build failures

## Monitoring

### Build Logs to Watch For
- ✅ `API route called during build time - skipping execution` (expected)
- ✅ `Stripe initialization failed: ...` (expected during build)
- ❌ `React error #31` (should not appear)
- ❌ `t.status is not a function` (should not appear)
- ❌ `Cannot read properties of undefined` (should not appear)

## Maintenance

### Adding New API Routes
When creating new API routes, always:
1. Add build-time safety check at the beginning
2. Use safe header setting methods
3. Handle environment variable access safely
4. Test build process after adding new routes

### Example Template
```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Build-time safety check
  if (!req || !res || typeof res.status !== 'function') {
    console.warn('API route called during build time - skipping execution');
    return { notFound: true };
  }
  
  // Safe header setting
  try {
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Unable to set headers during build time:', error.message);
    return { notFound: true };
  }
  
  // Your API logic here...
}
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Build completes successfully on Netlify
- ✅ No React error #31 during build
- ✅ API routes function correctly in production
- ✅ Stripe payments work as expected
- ✅ All environment variables handled safely
- ✅ Build time reduced by avoiding unnecessary static generation
