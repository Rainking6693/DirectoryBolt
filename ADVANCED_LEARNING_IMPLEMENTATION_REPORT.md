**Advanced Capabilities:**
```typescript
// AI-powered query suggestions
const queries = await axiom.suggestQueries("Show me slow API requests from last hour");

// Automatic dashboard generation
const dashboard = await axiom.generateDashboard("Customer behavior analytics");

// Real-time tracing
const result = await axiom.trace('customer_lookup', async () => {
  return await database.getCustomer(customerId);
});
```

const orchestrator = new AdvancedAnalyticsOrchestrator();
await orchestrator.initialize();

// Track customer actions across all systems
await orchestrator.trackCustomerAction(customerId, 'submission_created', metadata);

// Get AI-powered recommendations
const recommendations = await orchestrator.getCustomerRecommendations(customerId);

// Monitor and optimize performance
const optimization = await orchestrator.optimizeCustomerQuery(customerId);
```
