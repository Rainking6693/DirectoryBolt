# 🚨 EMERGENCY NETLIFY DIAGNOSIS - DirectoryBolt API Failures

**Mission Commander:** Emily  
**Status:** INVESTIGATING REAL ROOT CAUSE  
**User Correction:** Environment variables ARE configured in Netlify

---

## 🔍 CORRECTED INVESTIGATION APPROACH

You were absolutely right - the environment variables are configured in Netlify. The issue is deeper than environment configuration.

## 🎯 LIKELY ROOT CAUSES

### 1. **Netlify Functions Build Issue**
- Next.js API routes may not be converting to Netlify Functions properly
- The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` may have compatibility issues
- Build process may be failing silently

### 2. **Runtime Dependency Issues**
- `google-spreadsheet` library may not be compatible with Netlify Functions runtime
- CommonJS/ES module conflicts in serverless environment
- Missing dependencies in production build

### 3. **Function Timeout/Memory Issues**
- Google Sheets API calls may be timing out
- Functions may be running out of memory
- Cold start issues with large dependencies

### 4. **Import/Export Resolution Issues**
- Mixed import syntax causing runtime failures
- Module resolution failing in Netlify Functions environment
- TypeScript compilation issues

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Step 1: Check Netlify Build Logs
```bash
# Access Netlify dashboard and check:
1. Latest deployment logs
2. Function build status
3. Any build warnings/errors
4. Function deployment status
```

### Step 2: Test Function Deployment
```bash
# Check if functions are actually deployed:
curl https://directorybolt.com/.netlify/functions/health-google-sheets
# vs
curl https://directorybolt.com/api/health/google-sheets
```

### Step 3: Check Function Runtime Logs
```bash
# In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Functions tab
2. Check recent invocations
3. Look for runtime errors
4. Check function execution logs
```

## 🛠️ POTENTIAL FIXES

### Fix 1: Force Function Deployment
Create explicit Netlify Functions for critical endpoints:

```javascript
// netlify/functions/health-google-sheets.js
const { createGoogleSheetsService } = require('../../lib/services/google-sheets.js');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    const googleSheetsService = createGoogleSheetsService();
    const result = await googleSheetsService.healthCheck();
    
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        success: result,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      })
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        success: false,
        error: error.message,
        stack: error.stack
      })
    };
  }
};
```

### Fix 2: Update netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci --include=dev && npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.18.1"
  PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD = "true"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["google-spreadsheet", "google-auth-library"]

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
  
  [plugins.inputs]
    distDir = ".next"
```

### Fix 3: Simplify Google Sheets Service
Remove complex dependencies and use simpler HTTP requests to Google Sheets API.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Netlify Dashboard Investigation (5 minutes)
1. Access Netlify dashboard with provided token
2. Check DirectoryBolt site deployment status
3. Review build logs for errors
4. Check function deployment status

### Phase 2: Create Explicit Functions (10 minutes)
1. Create `netlify/functions/health-google-sheets.js`
2. Create `netlify/functions/customer-validate.js`
3. Deploy and test

### Phase 3: Test and Verify (5 minutes)
1. Test new function endpoints
2. Verify Google Sheets connectivity
3. Test AutoBolt extension integration

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ✅ API endpoints return 200 instead of 500
- ✅ Google Sheets health check passes
- ✅ Customer validation works
- ✅ AutoBolt extension can authenticate customers

**The real issue is likely in the Netlify Functions deployment/runtime, not environment variables. Let's get into Netlify and fix this properly.**
