## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Data Validation Enhancement
```sql
-- Add email format constraint
ALTER TABLE customers ADD CONSTRAINT valid_email 
CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+[.][A-Za-z]+$');

-- Add business name constraint
ALTER TABLE customers ADD CONSTRAINT valid_business_name 
CHECK (business_name != 'Unknown Business' AND length(business_name) > 0);
```

### 2. API Input Validation
- Implement server-side email validation
- Add business name format checking
- Prevent "test" data patterns
- Enforce required field validation

### 3. Migration Process Improvement
- Add data validation step before migration
- Implement field mapping verification
- Create test data detection and exclusion
- Add migration rollback procedures

---

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTINUED OPERATION

### Short Term (Next 24 Hours)
1. Deploy database constraints to prevent future data corruption
2. Update API validation rules
3. Monitor system performance closely
4. Implement additional data quality checks

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Create automated data quality monitoring
2. Implement customer data validation dashboard
3. Set up alerting for data integrity issues
4. Review and improve backup/restore procedures

### Long Term (Next Month)
