## üéØ MISSION OBJECTIVES

### PRIMARY GOAL
Transform Emily's backup implementation into fully deployed, specification-compliant system with live verification

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **Database Schema Compliance**: Rename tables to match original specs (`jobs`, `job_results`)
2. **API Endpoint Compliance**: Implement `/api/jobs/next`, `/api/jobs/update`, `/api/jobs/complete`
3. **Live System Verification**: Confirm all components work with real data
4. **AutoBolt Integration**: Ensure extension pulls from backend (not Supabase directly)
5. **Staff Dashboard Deployment**: Move from backup to active pages directory
