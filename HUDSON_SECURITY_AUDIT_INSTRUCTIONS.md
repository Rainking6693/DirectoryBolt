# üõ°Ô∏è HUDSON - SECURITY AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL SECURITY AUDIT REQUIRED**  
**Assigned to:** Hudson (Security Engineer)  
**Priority:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Requested by:** Emily (Security Specialist)

---

## üéØ **YOUR MISSION, HUDSON:**

Perform a deep security analysis to verify complete elimination of exposed credentials and assess the overall security posture of the DirectoryBolt codebase after Emily's cleanup.

---

## üîí **SPECIFIC SECURITY TASKS FOR YOU:**

### **TASK 1: ADVANCED PATTERN DETECTION**
Use sophisticated searches to find hidden or obfuscated credentials:

```bash
# Search for base64 encoded patterns
ripgrep_search "c2stcHJvai0=" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json","md","txt"]  # base64 for "sk-proj-"
ripgrep_search "c2tfdGVzdF81MQ==" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json","md","txt"]  # base64 for "sk_test_51"

# Search for hex encoded patterns  
ripgrep_search "736b2d70726f6a2d" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json","md","txt"]  # hex for "sk-proj-"

# Search for URL encoded patterns
ripgrep_search "sk%2Dproj%2D" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json","md","txt"]

# Search for split/concatenated keys
ripgrep_search "sk-\" + \"proj" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"]
ripgrep_search "sk_\" + \"test" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"]
```

### **TASK 2: ENVIRONMENT SECURITY ANALYSIS**
Analyze all environment-related files for security issues:

```bash
# Check all environment files
list_files_in_directories ["."]  # Look for any .env* files
read_files [".env.example", ".env.local", ".env.production"]

# Search for environment variable references that might leak keys
ripgrep_search "process.env" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"] --maxResults 50
```

### **TASK 3: CONFIGURATION FILE SECURITY**
Check configuration files for embedded secrets:

```bash
# Check package.json and other config files
read_files ["package.json", "next.config.js", "tailwind.config.js"]

# Search for any config files that might contain secrets
ripgrep_search "config" --fileTypes ["json","js","ts"] --maxResults 20
```

### **TASK 4: BINARY AND HIDDEN FILE ANALYSIS**
Check for secrets in non-obvious locations:

```bash
# List all directories to find hidden folders
directory_tree "."

# Check for any hidden files or unusual extensions
list_files_in_directories [".git", ".next", ".vercel"] 
```

### **TASK 5: CODE INJECTION VULNERABILITY SCAN**
Look for potential security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Search for dangerous patterns
ripgrep_search "eval\\(" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"]
ripgrep_search "innerHTML" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"] 
ripgrep_search "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"]

# Check for hardcoded URLs that might contain secrets
ripgrep_search "https://" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx"] --maxResults 30
```

### **TASK 6: DEPENDENCY SECURITY ANALYSIS**
Check for security issues in dependencies:

```bash
# Analyze package.json for security
read_files ["package.json", "package-lock.json"]

# Look for any custom scripts that might contain secrets
ripgrep_search "scripts" --fileTypes ["json"] --maxResults 10
```

---

## üîç **ADVANCED SECURITY CHECKS:**

### **1. ENTROPY ANALYSIS**
Look for high-entropy strings that might be keys:

```bash
# Search for long alphanumeric strings (potential keys)
ripgrep_search "[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,}" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json","md"]
```

### **2. CREDENTIAL PATTERN ANALYSIS**
Search for common credential patterns:

```bash
# API key patterns
ripgrep_search "api[_-]?key" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"] --caseSensitive false
ripgrep_search "secret[_-]?key" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"] --caseSensitive false
ripgrep_search "access[_-]?token" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"] --caseSensitive false

# Password patterns
ripgrep_search "password" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"] --caseSensitive false
ripgrep_search "passwd" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"] --caseSensitive false
```

### **3. NETWORK SECURITY ANALYSIS**
Check for insecure network configurations:

```bash
# Look for HTTP URLs (should be HTTPS)
ripgrep_search "http://" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"]

# Check for localhost references that might leak in production
ripgrep_search "localhost" --fileTypes ["js","ts","tsx","jsx","json"]
```
