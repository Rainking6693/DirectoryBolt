```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Auto-Bolt Business Directory Automator",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "scripting", "notifications"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://api.airtable.com/*", "https://auto-bolt.netlify.app/*"]
}
```

**üîç FINDINGS:**

    state: "State",
    zipCode: "12345",
    website: "https://business.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è INTEGRATION GAPS:**

## PHASE 4: CRITICAL TESTING EXECUTION

### Section 4.1: End-to-End Workflow Simulation

**üß™ TEST SCENARIO EXECUTION:**

**Test Case 1: Customer Onboarding Flow**
```
Status: ‚ùå FAILED - Missing Integration
Reason: DirectoryBolt website not connected to extension
Required: API endpoints for customer data transfer
```

**Test Case 2: Extension Queue Processing**
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Framework Present
Reason: Queue processor exists but not connected to live data
Required: Airtable API integration completion
```

**Test Case 3: Form Filling Automation**
```
Status: ‚úÖ READY - Core Engine Functional
Reason: Advanced form detection and filling capabilities confirmed
Note: Requires live customer data for full validation
```
