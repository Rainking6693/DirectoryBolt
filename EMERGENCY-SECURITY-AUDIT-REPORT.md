## CONCLUSION

DirectoryBolt demonstrates a **strong security foundation** with proper authentication, input validation, and payment security measures. However, **immediate attention is required** for payment processing reliability and authentication performance under load.

The identified vulnerabilities are manageable and do not pose immediate critical threats, but should be addressed within 24 hours to maintain security posture and regulatory compliance.

**Overall System Assessment:** 
- **Security:** GOOD (with medium-priority fixes needed)
- **Performance:** REQUIRES IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATION
- **Revenue Risk:** MEDIUM (due to payment processing issues)
