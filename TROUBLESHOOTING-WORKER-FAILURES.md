# Troubleshooting Worker Job Failures

## üö® **Issue: Jobs Immediately Going to "Failed" Status**

### **Root Cause**
The AI worker was polling the old `/api/autobolt/jobs/next` endpoint, which doesn't exist in the new queue system. This caused jobs to fail immediately without being processed.

### **Solution Applied**
Updated `workers/playwright-worker/src/aiWorker.ts` to poll the new queue system directly via Supabase.

## üîç **How to Diagnose Job Failures**

### **1. Check Render Logs**
Go to Render.com ‚Üí Your Worker Service ‚Üí Logs

Look for these patterns:

**‚úÖ Good (Working):**
```
üîç Polling for pending jobs...
üìã Found pending job { jobId: 'xxx', customerId: 'xxx' }
üìä Job has 100 pending submissions
ü§ñ Processing job with AI services
```

**‚ùå Bad (Failing):**
```
‚ùå Failed to fetch pending jobs
‚ùå Job processing failed
‚ùå API error
```

### **2. Check Supabase Database**

**Query pending jobs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**Query failed jobs:**
```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, status, error_message, created_at 
FROM jobs 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Query pending submissions:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM directory_submissions 
WHERE status = 'pending';
```

### **3. Check Environment Variables**

**Required in Render:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NETLIFY_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://directorybolt.com
WORKER_AUTH_TOKEN=your_worker_token_here
```

**Verify they're set:**
```bash
# In Render logs, you should see:
üöÄ AI-Enhanced Playwright Worker starting...
üì° Using new queue system with Supabase direct polling
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Failed to fetch pending jobs"**

**Cause:** Supabase credentials not set or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set
3. Check Supabase dashboard for correct values
4. Redeploy worker

### **Issue 2: "Job has no pending submissions"**

**Cause:** Webhook didn't create submission tasks

**Check webhook logs:**
```sql
-- Check if submissions were created
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM directory_submissions 
WHERE submission_queue_id = 'your-job-id';
```

**Fix:**
- Ensure webhook completed successfully
- Check Netlify function logs for errors
- Verify `directory_submissions` table exists

### **Issue 3: Jobs stuck in "pending"**

**Cause:** Worker not running or not polling

**Fix:**
1. Check Render logs for worker startup
2. Verify worker is healthy: `curl https://your-worker.onrender.com/health`
3. Check for errors in logs
4. Redeploy if necessary

### **Issue 4: "AI Processor not initialized"**

**Cause:** Missing AI API keys

**Fix:**
1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Render
2. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Render
3. Redeploy worker

### **Issue 5: TypeScript Compilation Errors**

**Cause:** AI service type mismatches

**Note:** These don't affect runtime in production Docker build

**If needed:**
```bash
cd workers/playwright-worker
npm run build  # Check for errors
```

---

## üìä **Health Check Commands**

### **1. Check Worker Health**
```bash
curl https://your-worker.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "ai-enhanced-playwright-worker",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T...",
  "aiServices": "enabled"
}
```

### **2. Check Database Connection**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_jobs,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs WHERE status = 'in_progress') as active_jobs,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM directory_submissions WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_submissions;
```

### **3. Test Job Creation**
```bash
# In staff dashboard, create a test customer
# Check logs immediately after
```

## üîÑ **Worker Flow Verification**

### **Expected Flow:**
```
1. Worker starts ‚Üí ‚úÖ "AI-Enhanced Playwright Worker starting..."
2. Polling begins ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Polling for pending jobs..."
3. Job found ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Found pending job"
4. Submissions fetched ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Job has X pending submissions"
5. Processing starts ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Starting AI-enhanced job processing"
6. Progress updates ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Processing job with AI services"
7. Job completes ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Job processing completed successfully"
```

### **If Flow Breaks:**

**At Step 1:**
- Check Render deployment status
- Check environment variables
- Check Docker build logs

**At Step 2:**
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**At Step 3:**
- Check if jobs exist in database
- Verify job status is 'pending'
- Check webhook logs

**At Step 4:**
- Verify `directory_submissions` records exist
- Check `submission_queue_id` matches job ID
- Verify status is 'pending'

**At Step 5-7:**
- Check AI service API keys
- Check Playwright browser installation
- Check memory/CPU limits on Render

## ‚úÖ **Verification Script**

Run this after deploying to verify everything:

```sql
-- 1. Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('jobs', 'directory_submissions', 'directories', 'customers');

-- 2. Check recent jobs
SELECT id, status, customer_id, created_at, error_message 
FROM jobs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Check submissions for latest job
SELECT 
  ds.id,
  ds.status,
  d.name as directory_name,
  ds.created_at
FROM directory_submissions ds
JOIN directories d ON d.id = ds.directory_id
WHERE ds.submission_queue_id = (SELECT id FROM jobs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Check worker heartbeats
SELECT * FROM worker_heartbeats ORDER BY last_seen DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

1. ‚úÖ Worker polls Supabase directly (no old API calls)
2. ‚úÖ Jobs progress from pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
3. ‚úÖ Submissions update as they're processed
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard shows real-time progress
5. ‚úÖ No immediate failures

**The worker is now fully compatible with the new queue system!**
