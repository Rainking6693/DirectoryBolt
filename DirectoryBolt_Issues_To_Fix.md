2. **AI Analysis Enhancement** (justifying premium pricing)
3. **Tier Differentiation** (showing value difference)
4. **Export Functionality** (delivering promised features)
5. **Customer Onboarding** (AI-enhanced experience)

**Estimated Development Time:** 2-3 weeks for critical fixes, 2-3 months for complete implementation.
