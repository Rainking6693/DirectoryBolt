    M --> N[Review report generated]
    N --> O[PR comment with results]
```

### Review System Architecture

#### 1. Quick Review (Pre-commit)
- **Runtime**: < 30 seconds
- **Focus**: Critical security issues, basic quality checks
- **Tools**: Pattern matching, simple static analysis
- **Exit codes**: Blocks commits with critical issues

#### 2. Enhanced Review (CI/CD)
- **Runtime**: 5-10 minutes
- **Focus**: Comprehensive analysis, performance impact
- **Tools**: ESLint, TypeScript compiler, custom analyzers
- **Outputs**: Detailed reports, PR comments, artifacts

### Security Analysis Features

#### Pattern-Based Detection
```javascript
const securityPatterns = [
  {
    pattern: /eval\s*\(/gi,
    message: 'Dangerous use of eval() - potential code injection vulnerability',
    severity: 'critical'
  },
  {
    pattern: /innerHTML\s*=/gi,
    message: 'Potential XSS vulnerability with innerHTML',
    severity: 'high'
  },
  {
    pattern: /(api[_-]?key|secret|token)\s*[=:]\s*['"][^'"]+['"]/gi,
    message: 'Potential hardcoded secret detected',
    severity: 'critical'
  }
];
```

#### Advanced Security Rules
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Environment variable validation
- Cookie security flag verification
- CORS policy validation

### Performance Analysis Features

#### Metrics Tracked
- **Bundle Size**: Monitors JavaScript bundle growth
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Identifies overly complex functions
- **Function Length**: Flags functions exceeding 50 lines
- **Code Duplication**: Detects duplicate code blocks
- **Build Performance**: Tracks compilation times

#### Performance Budgets
```json
{
  "performance": {
    "thresholds": {
      "maxBundleSize": 1000000,
      "maxComplexity": 10,
      "maxFunctionLength": 50,
      "minTestCoverage": 80
    }
  }
}
```

### Quality Analysis Features

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Enforces type safety
- **Documentation Coverage**: Ensures public APIs are documented
- **Test Coverage**: Validates test presence for new code
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Monitors TODO/FIXME comments

#### Policy Enforcement
- **Automated TypeScript Migration**: Suggests .js to .ts conversion
- **Documentation Requirements**: Flags missing JSDoc
- **Test Requirements**: Ensures test files exist for source code
- **Naming Conventions**: Validates consistent naming patterns

## 🛠 Tools and Integrations
