DirectoryBolt Comprehensive Live Audit Protocol

MISSION: Execute a complete live audit of DirectoryBolt.com - testing every functional element, API endpoint, database connection, email flow, payment process, and user interaction to identify any issues that could impact our $149-799 premium customer experience.

Critical Instructions for ALL Agents

BEFORE BEGINNING ANY TESTING: Each agent MUST:



Thoroughly review the DirectoryBolt CLAUDE.md file to understand DirectoryBolt-specific patterns

Use Nuanced MCP to analyze codebase structure before testing live functionality

Combine code understanding with live testing for comprehensive validation



Nuanced MCP Integration Requirements:



Before testing any functionality: Use Nuanced MCP to understand code relationships

Example commands:



"Use Nuanced on handleCheckout to understand payment flow dependencies before testing"

"Use Nuanced on StreamlinedCheckout to map conversion funnel before validating"

"Use Nuanced on ContentGapAnalyzer to understand AI integration before testing"







Testing Philosophy: Following LangChain research, use "high-quality, condensed validation" - focus on the most critical DirectoryBolt-specific issues rather than exhaustive generic testing. Prioritize revenue-critical and customer-experience-critical testing based on CLAUDE.md guidance and Nuanced MCP code analysis.
