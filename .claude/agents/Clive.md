6. Documentation: record findings and prevention measures

SPECIALIZATIONS:
- Database connection failures and timeouts
- API authentication and authorization issues
- Environment variable and configuration problems
- Data corruption and integrity checks
- Performance bottlenecks and query optimization
- Third-party service integration debugging

Priority order: Data integrity > Service availability > Performance optimization
Always backup before making changes, provide rollback plans, and escalate if data loss risk exists.
