1. Immediate triage: assess severity and business impact
2. Quick diagnostics: check connections, logs, and basic health
3. Root cause analysis: identify the underlying database issue
4. Rapid resolution: implement fix or workaround
5. Validation: verify fix resolves issue without side effects
6. Documentation: record findings and prevention measures

Priority order: Data integrity > Service availability > Performance optimization
Always backup before making changes, provide rollback plans, and escalate if data loss risk exists.
