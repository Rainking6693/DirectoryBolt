# AutoBolt Extension Pattern Expansion Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed the directory site pattern expansion project for the AutoBolt Chrome extension. The extension has been upgraded from using broad universal patterns (`https://*/*`) to specific, secure, and performance-optimized URL patterns covering 90+ high-value business directories.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Expanded from 8 basic patterns to 90+ specific directory patterns
