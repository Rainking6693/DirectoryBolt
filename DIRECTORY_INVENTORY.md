## 🚀 **How to Use with Gemini Worker**

### **1. Load Directory List:**
```javascript
const directories = require('./directories/complete-directory-database.json');

// Filter by difficulty
const easyDirectories = directories.directories.filter(d => 
  d.difficulty === 'easy' || d.submission_difficulty <= 2
);

console.log(`Found ${easyDirectories.length} CAPTCHA-free directories`);
```

### **2. Test Batch (10 directories):**
```javascript
const testBatch = easyDirectories.slice(0, 10);

for (const directory of testBatch) {
  console.log(`Testing: ${directory.name}`);
  const result = await submitter.submitToDirectory(
    directory.website,
    businessData
  );
  console.log(`  Result: ${result.status}`);
}
```

### **3. Scale to All Easy Directories:**
```javascript
// Process all 173 easy directories
for (const directory of easyDirectories) {
  const result = await processDirectory(directory);
  await saveResult(result);
  await delay(2000); // Rate limiting
}
```

## 📋 **Field Mapping**

All directories have **100% field mapping coverage**, meaning for each directory you have:

```json
{
  "name": "Directory Name",
  "website": "https://directory.com",
  "category": "general-directory",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "submission_difficulty": 1,
  "tier": 1,
  "domain_authority": 65,
  "form_fields": [
    {
      "name": "business_name",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "max_length": 100
    },
    {
      "name": "business_email",
      "type": "email",
      "required": true
    },
    // ... all other fields
  ],
  "submission_requirements": {
    "account_needed": false,
    "approval_process": "automatic",
    "verification_required": false
  }
}
```

This means Gemini knows **exactly** what to fill in for each directory!
