# AutoBolt Queue Management System - Phase 3.1 Implementation Complete

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All Phase 3, Section 3.1 tasks implemented  
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Agent:** Shane (Backend Developer)  

---

## PHASE 3.1 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

✅ **3.1.1: AutoBolt reads "pending" records from Airtable**
- Implemented `QueueManager.getPendingQueue()` method
- Reads all customers with `submissionStatus = "pending"`
- Sorts by priority and creation date

✅ **3.1.2: Queue processor respects packageType limits**  
- Directory limits: starter(50), growth(100), pro(200), subscription(0)
- Priority system: Pro > Growth > Starter > Subscription
- Package-aware processing logic

✅ **3.1.3: Update submissionStatus during processing**
- Status flow: pending → in-progress → completed/failed
- Real-time Airtable updates during processing
- Directory submission tracking (successful/failed counts)

✅ **3.1.4: Batch processing with delays between submissions**
- Configurable batch size (default: 3 concurrent)
- 2-second delays between batches
- Prevents overwhelming external systems

✅ **3.1.5: Error handling and retry logic**  
- 3 retry attempts per customer
- 5-second delays between retries
- Graceful failure handling with detailed logging

---

## IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS

### 1. Queue Manager Service (`lib/services/queue-manager.ts`)

**Core Class:** `QueueManager`

**Key Methods:**
- `getPendingQueue()` - Fetch and prioritize pending customers
- `processQueue()` - Process entire queue with batch logic
- `processCustomer()` - Handle individual customer with retries
- `updateSubmissionStatus()` - Update customer status in Airtable
- `getQueueStats()` - Get queue statistics

**Features:**
- Priority-based processing (Pro customers first)
- Concurrent processing with rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Queue depth and processing metrics

### 2. API Endpoints

#### `/api/autobolt/queue-status` (GET)
- Returns current queue statistics
- Shows processing status and next customer
- Rate limited: 20 req/min per IP

#### `/api/autobolt/process-queue` (POST)
- Starts queue processing (entire queue)
- Process specific customer: `?customerId=xxx`
- Rate limited: 5 req/min per IP

#### `/api/autobolt/pending-customers` (GET)
- Lists customers waiting for processing
- Supports pagination: `?limit=10&offset=0`
- Rate limited: 10 req/min per IP

#### `/api/autobolt/customer-status` (GET/POST)
- GET: Get customer status by ID
- POST: Update customer status (internal use)
- Rate limited: 30 req/min per IP

#### `/api/autobolt/queue` (POST) - Enhanced
- Validates customer exists in Airtable
- Ensures proper workflow: payment → form → queue
- Returns queue position and estimated completion

### 3. Testing Suite (`scripts/test-queue-system.js`)

**Comprehensive test coverage:**
- API endpoint validation
- Rate limiting verification
- Pagination testing
- Error handling validation
- Response format verification

## CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

### Environment Variables (.env.local)

**Required for queue system to function:**

```env
# Airtable Configuration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Business_Submissions
```

**How to get Airtable credentials:**

1. **API Key:** Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
   - Create new token with `data.records:read` and `data.records:write` permissions
   - Copy the token (starts with `pat...`)

2. **Base ID:** From your Airtable base URL
   - URL format: `https://airtable.com/{BASE_ID}/...`
   - BASE_ID starts with `app...`

3. **Table Name:** Name of your table (default: `Business_Submissions`)

## QUEUE PROCESSING WORKFLOW

### Customer Journey:
```
1. Customer Payment → Stripe Success
2. Business Info Form → Stored in Airtable (status: "pending")
3. AutoBolt Queue → Customer ready for processing
4. Queue Manager → Processes customer (status: "in-progress")
5. Directory Submissions → External processing
6. Completion → Status updated to "completed" or "failed"
```

### Processing Logic:
```
1. Fetch pending customers from Airtable
2. Sort by priority (Pro → Growth → Starter → Subscription)
3. Process in batches of 3 concurrent customers
4. For each customer:
   - Update status to "in-progress"
   - Process directory submissions (with retry logic)
   - Update final status with results
5. Add delays between batches to prevent rate limiting
```

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Queue Priority System:
- **Pro Package:** Priority 100 + time bonus
- **Growth Package:** Priority 75 + time bonus  
- **Starter Package:** Priority 50 + time bonus
- **Subscription:** Priority 25 + time bonus

### Directory Limits:
- **Starter:** 50 directories
- **Growth:** 100 directories
- **Pro:** 200 directories
- **Subscription:** 0 (ongoing maintenance, not bulk)

### Error Handling:
- **Network errors:** 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **API failures:** Graceful degradation with logging
- **Rate limits:** Automatic delay and retry
- **Invalid data:** Skip with detailed error logging

### Rate Limiting:
- **Queue Status:** 20 requests/minute per IP
- **Process Queue:** 5 requests/minute per IP (resource-intensive)
- **Customer Status:** 30 requests/minute per IP
- **Pending Customers:** 10 requests/minute per IP

---

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### With Phase 2 (Customer Onboarding):
- Reads customer data from `createAirtableService()`
- Uses existing business info form data
- Maintains customer ID consistency

### With AutoBolt Extension (Phase 3.2):
- `processDirectorySubmissions()` method ready for extension integration
- Customer business data available for form filling
- Directory limits enforced per package type

### With Customer Communication (Phase 5):
- Status tracking API for customer portal
- Progress percentage calculation
- Detailed completion reports

---

## MONITORING & METRICS

### Queue Statistics:
- Total pending customers
- Total in-progress customers  
- Total completed customers
- Total failed customers
- Average processing time
- Current queue depth

### Processing Metrics:
- Success/failure rates per package type
- Processing time per directory
- Retry attempt tracking
- Error categorization and frequency

---

## NEXT STEPS FOR FULL ACTIVATION

### Immediate (Required):
1. **Configure Airtable credentials** in `.env.local`
2. **Test with real customer data** from Phase 2
3. **Verify API endpoints** work with Airtable connection

### Phase 3.2 Integration:
1. **AutoBolt Extension integration** in `processDirectorySubmissions()`
2. **Master directory list** loading and mapping
3. **Form field mapping** for each directory

### Production Deployment:
1. **Redis integration** for rate limiting (replace in-memory store)
2. **Monitoring dashboards** for queue health
3. **Alert systems** for failed processing
4. **Performance optimization** for high-volume processing

---

## TESTING

### API Testing:
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
node scripts/test-queue-system.js

# Manual API testing
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/autobolt/queue-status"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/autobolt/pending-customers"
```

### Expected Results (with Airtable configured):
- All API endpoints return JSON responses
- Queue statistics show real customer data
- Processing functions work end-to-end

---

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### API Security:
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- IP-based request tracking
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message sanitization

### Data Protection:
- Secure Airtable API key handling
- Customer data access logging
- PII protection in logs
- Encrypted data transmission

### Access Control:
- Internal API endpoints protected
- Customer data access restricted
- Processing queue access controlled
