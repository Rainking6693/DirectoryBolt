- Encrypted password storage (bcrypt hashing)
- API key management with permissions
- Audit logging for all critical operations

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (public, authenticated, service_role)
- Customer data isolation
- VA assignment restrictions
- Admin-only operations protection

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Customer Creation
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (email, password_hash, full_name, subscription_tier, business_data)
VALUES ('customer@example.com', '$2a$12$...', 'John Doe', 'pro', 
        '{"industry": "Technology", "website": "https://example.com"}');
```

### Queue Item Creation
```sql
INSERT INTO submission_queue (customer_id, directory_id, business_data, priority)
VALUES ('customer-uuid', 'directory-uuid', 
        '{"business_name": "Example Corp", "business_url": "https://example.com"}', 2);
```

### VA Action Assignment
```sql
INSERT INTO pending_actions (customer_id, directory_id, action_type, title, assigned_to_va_id)
VALUES ('customer-uuid', 'directory-uuid', 'sms_verification', 
        'Verify SMS for Business Directory', 'va_001');
```

## Migration Execution

### Forward Migration
```bash
# Run migrations in order
psql -f migrations/011_create_customers_table.sql
psql -f migrations/012_create_submission_queue_table.sql
psql -f migrations/013_create_pending_actions_table.sql
psql -f migrations/014_create_directory_submissions_table.sql
psql -f migrations/015_add_foreign_key_constraints.sql
```

### Rollback Process
```bash
# Rollback in reverse order
psql -f migrations/rollback_015_remove_constraints.sql
psql -f migrations/rollback_014_drop_directory_submissions.sql
psql -f migrations/rollback_013_drop_pending_actions.sql
psql -f migrations/rollback_012_drop_submission_queue.sql
psql -f migrations/rollback_011_drop_customers.sql
```

## Maintenance Functions

### Daily Analytics Generation
```sql
SELECT generate_daily_analytics(CURRENT_DATE);
```

### Dashboard Refresh
```sql
SELECT refresh_dashboard_summary();
```

### Data Cleanup
```sql
SELECT cleanup_old_data(); -- Removes data older than retention periods
```

### Customer Billing Reset
```sql
SELECT reset_customer_billing_period('customer-uuid');
```

## Performance Recommendations

### Regular Maintenance
1. Run `ANALYZE` on tables after bulk operations
2. Refresh materialized views during low-traffic periods
3. Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes
4. Regularly update table statistics

### Query Optimization
1. Use prepared statements for repeated queries
2. Leverage partial indexes for filtered queries  
3. Use JSONB operators efficiently for business_data queries
4. Monitor slow queries and add indexes as needed

## Testing and Validation

### Data Integrity Tests
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Enum value constraint testing
- JSONB schema validation
- Trigger function testing

### Performance Testing
- Query performance under load
- Index effectiveness measurement
- Concurrent access testing
- Batch processing throughput

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Foreign key violations**: Check data consistency before migration
- **Index creation timeouts**: Use CONCURRENTLY option for large tables
- **JSONB query performance**: Ensure proper GIN indexes
- **Trigger conflicts**: Review trigger execution order

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Monitor active connections
SELECT count(*) as active_connections FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced analytics with machine learning insights
- Real-time notification system integration
- API rate limiting and quota management
- Enhanced security with two-factor authentication

### Scalability Considerations
- Table partitioning for large datasets
