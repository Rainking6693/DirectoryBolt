## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue: Build still fails

**Solution 1: Clear cache**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

**Solution 2: Verify files**
```bash
# Should NOT exist
ls app/page.tsx  # Should fail

# Should exist
ls pages/index.tsx  # Should succeed
ls app/layout.tsx  # Should succeed
```

**Solution 3: Clear Netlify cache**
- Netlify dashboard > Site settings > Build & deploy > Clear cache

---

### Issue: Admin pages not loading

**Check:**
1. Verify `app/layout.tsx` exists
2. Verify `app/admin/layout.tsx` exists
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify navigation links are correct
