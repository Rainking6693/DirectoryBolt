# Emily Backend Architecture Audit - DirectoryBolt Job Queue System
**Priority:** High - Revenue Critical Architecture Verification  
**Assigned to:** Emily (Backend Architecture Specialist)  
**Due:** Immediate audit required  
**Status:** ACTIVE MISSION  
**Hudson Authority:** MANDATORY audit approval required before any agent proceeds

---

## Mission Overview

Based on the attached conversation document, we need to verify if our current DirectoryBolt backend matches the 3-tier job queue architecture that was specifically requested. The audit reports show API fixes, but they don't confirm the core architectural requirements.

**CRITICAL:** Again, NO FAKE DATA, OR USING OUTDATED FILES.

---

## Required Architecture (What We Should Have)

### Tier 1: Supabase Database Layer
- **Existing:** `customers` table (sign-up data)
- **Required:** Two NEW tables in Supabase:
  - `jobs` table - tracks directory submission jobs
  - `job_results` table - tracks per-directory submission status

### Tier 2: Backend API Layer
- **Purpose:** Acts as "traffic cop" between Supabase and AutoBolt
- **Security:** Uses Supabase service keys (server-side only)
- **Authentication:** Provides custom API key for AutoBolt (NOT Supabase keys)

### Tier 3: AutoBolt Chrome Extension
- **Behavior:** Pulls jobs from Backend API (NOT directly from Supabase)
- **Security:** Only has Backend API key (NO Supabase access)

---

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Database Schema Verification with Nuanced MCP
**MANDATORY:** Use Nuanced MCP Server for code analysis throughout this audit.

```bash
# Use Nuanced MCP to analyze database schema and API structure:
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/next.ts to analyze job queue API implementation"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/update.ts to map job progress tracking architecture"
"Use Nuanced on components/staff/JobProgressMonitor.tsx to understand real-time monitoring implementation"
"Use Nuanced on lib/supabase/jobs.ts to verify job queue database operations"
```

**Database Tables Check:**
```sql
-- 1. Jobs table should exist with these exact columns:
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'jobs';

-- Expected structure:
-- id (uuid, primary key)
-- customer_id (uuid, references customers)
-- package_size (int, check: 50/100/500)
-- status (text, check: pending/in_progress/complete/failed)
-- created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)

-- 2. Job results table should exist:
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'job_results';

-- Expected structure:
-- id (uuid, primary key)  
-- job_id (uuid, references jobs)
-- directory_name (text)
-- status (text, check: pending/submitted/failed/retry)
-- response_log (jsonb)
-- submitted_at (timestamptz)
```

### 2. Backend API Endpoints Verification with Nuanced MCP

Use Nuanced MCP to analyze the complete API architecture:

```bash
# Map the job management API endpoints:
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/next.ts to verify job queue implementation"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/update.ts to analyze progress tracking"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/complete.ts to check job completion handling"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/jobs/fail.ts to review failure management"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/autobolt/jobs to understand AutoBolt integration points"
```

**Check if these endpoints exist and work:**
```bash
# 1. Get next job for AutoBolt
GET /jobs/next
# Should return: job_id, customer data, package_size

# 2. Update job progress  
POST /jobs/update
# Should accept: job_id, directory_name, status, response_log

# 3. Mark job complete
POST /jobs/complete  
# Should accept: job_id

# 4. Report job failure
POST /jobs/fail
# Should accept: job_id, error_message
```

### 3. Security Implementation Check

**Verify proper key separation:**
- **Supabase Service Key:** Only in backend environment variables
- **Custom Backend API Key:** Generated separately, used by AutoBolt
- **AutoBolt Extension:** Should NOT have any Supabase keys

### 4. Data Flow Verification

**Test the complete pipeline:**
1. Customer signs up → stored in `customers` table
2. Job created → inserted into `jobs` table
3. AutoBolt calls `/jobs/next` → gets customer data from backend
4. AutoBolt submits to directories → calls `/jobs/update` for each
5. AutoBolt finishes → calls `/jobs/complete`
6. Results stored in `job_results` table

## Real-Time Dashboard & Staff Interface Audit with Nuanced MCP

**Critical Missing Component:** The audits show API connectivity but provide zero evidence of the requested real-time monitoring interface.

**MANDATORY:** Use Nuanced MCP to analyze all dashboard and monitoring components:

```bash
# Analyze real-time monitoring implementation:
"Use Nuanced on components/staff/JobProgressMonitor.tsx to understand real-time job tracking"
"Use Nuanced on pages/staff/dashboard.tsx to map staff interface architecture"
"Use Nuanced on hooks/useJobProgress.ts to analyze real-time data updates"
"Use Nuanced on lib/websocket/jobUpdates.ts to verify live status streaming"
"Use Nuanced on pages/api/staff/jobs/status.ts to check staff job management APIs"
```

### Staff Dashboard Requirements Check:
- **Real-time job progress visualization** - Can staff see "57/100 directories complete" live?
- **AutoBolt performance monitoring** - Visual status of what AutoBolt is currently doing?
- **Job queue management interface** - Can staff start/stop/retry jobs through UI?
- **Directory submission tracking** - Which directories succeeded/failed with timestamps?
- **Live status updates** - Does the interface refresh as AutoBolt works?

### Required Nuanced MCP Analysis:
```bash
# Map the complete staff interface architecture:
"Use Nuanced on components/staff/ to analyze all staff dashboard components"
"Use Nuanced on pages/staff/ to map staff interface pages and functionality"
"Use Nuanced on lib/realtime/ to verify real-time update mechanisms"
"Use Nuanced on hooks/staff/ to understand staff-specific data management"
```

### Required Screenshots/Evidence:
- Staff dashboard showing active jobs with progress bars
- Real-time directory submission status updates
- Job management controls (start/pause/retry buttons)
- AutoBolt performance metrics display
- Visual job queue with pending/in-progress/complete states

---

## Critical Questions to Answer

### Architecture Questions:
1. Do we have the 2 new Supabase tables (`jobs` and `job_results`)?
2. Does AutoBolt pull from the backend API or still directly from Supabase?
3. Is there proper key separation (backend uses Supabase keys, AutoBolt uses custom API key)?

### Implementation Questions:
1. What happens when AutoBolt crashes mid-job? Can it resume?
2. How does staff trigger jobs? Through dashboard or manual process?
3. Can we track job progress? (57/100 directories complete)

### Security Questions:
1. Where are the Supabase service keys stored? (Should be backend-only)
2. Does AutoBolt have any Supabase access? (Should be NO)
3. How is the custom backend API key managed?

## What the Audit Reports Don't Show

**The existing audit reports show:**
- ✅ API connectivity working (503 errors fixed)
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Database columns added by Frank
- ✅ Chrome extension communication

**But they DON'T verify:**
- ❓ Proper 3-tier architecture implementation
- ❓ Job queue system functionality
- ❓ Security key separation
- ❓ AutoBolt data flow through backend (not Supabase)

---

## Current Gap Analysis

**The existing audits only verify:**
- APIs return 200 status codes
- Backend can communicate with Chrome extension
- Database tables exist and are accessible

**What's Missing:** Visual proof that staff can actually monitor and control AutoBolt operations through a real-time interface, which was specifically requested.

**Nuanced MCP Must Reveal:**
- Component architecture for real-time monitoring
- WebSocket or polling implementation for live updates
- Staff control interfaces for job management
- Data flow from AutoBolt → Backend → Staff Dashboard

---

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Verification Report
- Confirm 3-tier structure exists (or identify what's missing)
- Database schema audit results
- API endpoint functionality test results

### 2. Security Audit
- Key management verification
- Access control confirmation
- AutoBolt permissions review

### 3. Data Flow Test
- End-to-end job processing test
- Progress tracking verification

- Specific fixes needed to meet requirements

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **PASS:** Architecture matches the 3-tier job queue system described in the document
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL:** Some components exist but need fixes/completion
- ❌ **FAIL:** Still using direct Supabase access or missing core components
