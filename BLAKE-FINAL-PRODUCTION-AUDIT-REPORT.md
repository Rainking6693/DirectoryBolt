## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. Payment Processing Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- REQUIRED: Create Stripe events table
CREATE TABLE stripe_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    stripe_event_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT
);
```

### 2. Environment Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Missing Required Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI features will fail
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Backup AI service unavailable
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Payment processing broken
- `STRIPE_*_PRICE_ID` - Product pricing not configured

### 3. Webhook Processing (CRITICAL)
**Missing Webhook Handler Logic:**
- Event deduplication system
- Payment confirmation processing
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Failed payment handling
- Customer notification system

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### Validated Security Measures ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ JWT token authentication
- ‚úÖ API rate limiting configured

## üéØ EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

If deployment MUST proceed despite risks:

### Minimum Viable Fixes (3-5 days):
1. **Create stripe_events table** and basic webhook processing
2. **Configure all required environment variables**
3. **Implement payment confirmation workflow**
4. **Test end-to-end payment processing**
5. **Set up basic error monitoring**

### Workaround Solutions:
