# 🔧 AI Services Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Required API Key

Before using the AI services, you need to get an **Anthropic API Key** (Claude AI).

### Step 1: Get Your Anthropic API Key

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Click **Create Key**
5. Copy your API key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-actual-key-here
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run the test script:

```bash
node test-ai-services-integration.js
```

You should see all services pass ✅

## 💰 API Costs

Anthropic Claude API pricing (as of 2025):
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens
- **Estimated Monthly Cost:** $50-200 depending on usage
- **Per Submission:** ~$0.001-0.01 (very affordable!)

### Cost Optimization Tips:
1. Enable caching (already configured in services)
2. Use success probability filtering (saves API calls)
3. Monitor usage in Anthropic dashboard
4. Set budget alerts

## 🚀 Once Setup is Complete

### Test the Integration:
```bash
# 1. Test all services
node test-ai-services-integration.js

# 2. Check integration status
node integrate-ai-services-quick-start.js

# 3. Build the worker
cd workers/playwright-worker
npm run build

# 4. Test a single submission
# (Will be ready after Phase 1 completion)
```

### Deploy to Railway:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate all AI services for improved success rates"
git push
```

Railway will automatically deploy the updated worker with all AI services!
