## üö® IMMEDIATE CRITICAL ACTION

**DEPLOY SHANE NOW** to fix API endpoints and 500 errors:

### 1. Fix /api/health endpoint
The health endpoint is critical for system monitoring and should return proper status:
```javascript
// pages/api/health.ts should return:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-11T18:05:00Z",
  "uptime": "running",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 2. Fix /api/guides endpoint  
Currently returns 404, needs to return guide data:
```javascript
// pages/api/guides.ts should return:
[
  {
    "id": "airbnb-host-listing",
    "title": "Airbnb Host Guide",
    "category": "Hospitality",
    "difficulty": "intermediate"
  }
  // ... more guides
]
```

### 3. Fix homepage 500 errors
The homepage depends on API data and is currently broken:
- Debug the 500 error on root path `/`
- Ensure all data dependencies are working
- Test homepage loads with 200 status
