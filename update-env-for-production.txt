DirectoryBolt Local Development Fix
===================================

PROBLEM: Your local .env.local is pointing to localhost:54321 (local Supabase) 
but you don't have a local Supabase instance running.

SOLUTION: Update your .env.local to use your production Supabase credentials

STEPS:
------

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard (supabase.com)
2. Select your DirectoryBolt project  
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy these values:

   - Project URL (starts with https://...)
   - anon/public key (starts with eyJhbGci...)  
   - service_role key (starts with eyJhbGci...)

5. Update your .env.local file with these values:

   SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...YOUR_ANON_KEY...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGci...YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY...

6. Restart your development server:
   npm run dev

7. Test the staff dashboard:
   http://localhost:3000/staff-dashboard

IMPORTANT: 
- Use the SAME credentials that work in your Netlify production environment
- The service_role key is the most important one for the staff dashboard to work
- Keep TEST_MODE=true for local development

Your production site works fine because Netlify has the correct environment variables.
This fix will make your local development environment work the same way.
