## 🎯 What Happens Now

**Every minute**, the system will:

2. ✅ Pick the highest priority job
3. ✅ Mark it as 'in_progress'
4. ✅ Create job_results entries for each directory
5. ✅ Ready for AutoBolt extension to process

**When customers purchase:**
1. ✅ Webhook creates customer record
2. ✅ Webhook creates job record
3. ✅ Cron job picks it up within 1 minute
4. ✅ Job_results created for each directory
5. ✅ AutoBolt extension processes them

## 🆘 If Something Doesn't Work

### Cron Job Not Running?
```bash
# Manually trigger it:
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### Jobs Not Processing?
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify CRON_SECRET is set correctly

### Still Getting "Failed to Fetch"?
1. Verify SQL script ran successfully
2. Check tables exist in Supabase
3. Check RLS policies are enabled
