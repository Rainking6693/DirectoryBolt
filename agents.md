# Repository Guidelines

# - Repository Structure

## Project Structure & Module Organization

follows a standard Next.js 14 structure with TypeScript. Source code is organized in `/pages` for Next.js pages and API routes, `/components` for React components grouped by feature (ai-cleanup, receipts, reports, client-portal, etc.), `/lib` for utilities, database connections, AI services, and type definitions, and `/public` for static assets. The `/integrations` directory contains QuickBooks API and OCR service integrations.

üèóÔ∏è System Overview

DirectoryBolt is a SaaS platform that automates business directory submissions using a hybrid AI + headless browser architecture.

Submissions are orchestrated through a queue system in Supabase.

Jobs are processed by distributed Playwright workers running inside Docker containers.

The new AI-Enhanced Worker Process replaces the original static job execution loop, bringing probabilistic job selection, auto-form detection, and intelligent retries.

Primary Goals of the Agent Architecture:

Maximize successful directory submissions per minute.

Minimize human mapping and retry intervention.

Continuously learn from past submissions to optimize future outcomes.

All agents communicate via secure Netlify API endpoints.

Job state is persisted to Supabase (jobs, job_results, autobolt_submission_logs).

Agent decisions are logged and explainable (probabilities, confidence, mapping choices, retry categories).

üß∞ Core Agents
1. ü§ñ AIEnhancedQueueManager

Role: Intelligent job scheduler.
Trigger: Polls for next job from Supabase.
Responsibilities:

Pull all pending jobs.

Calculate success probability for each using trained AI scoring functions.

Select job with highest expected throughput, not oldest in queue.

Mark job in_progress and hand off to SubmissionOrchestratorAgent.

AI Inputs:

Job metadata (tier, business type)

Historical success data by category

Worker load balance

Directory category match rates

2. üß≠ SubmissionOrchestratorAgent

Role: Job supervisor and coordinator.
Trigger: Activated when job assigned.
Responsibilities:

Load directory package (50 / 100 / 300 / 500).

Filter out non-processable directories (captcha, login required, etc.).

Sort by AI priority scoring (timing, difficulty, historical patterns).

Spawn worker execution loop.

Maintain atomic job progress updates to Supabase.

Key Enhancements:

Real-time timing optimization (approval-window aware).

Adaptive job sequencing.

3. üõ†Ô∏è AIEnhancedWorkerAgent

Role: Executes directory submissions at scale.
Trigger: Receives one directory at a time from Orchestrator.
Responsibilities:

Compute AI Success Probability for this directory + business.

If score < 0.6, skip immediately.

Initialize AI services:

SubmissionTimingOptimizer

SuccessProbabilityCalculator

DescriptionCustomizer

AIFormMapper

IntelligentRetryAnalyzer

A/B Testing Framework

PerformanceFeedbackLoop

Route to appropriate executor:

Gemini for hard, anti-bot directories.

Playwright for standard directories.

Outputs: Submission result (success / failed / skipped) with full AI metadata.

4. üìù AIFormMapper

Role: Dynamic form detection and mapping.
Trigger: Directory with no predefined mapping.
Responsibilities:

Analyze page HTML.

Detect form fields automatically.

Match fields to business data.

Return mapping with confidence scores.

Cache successful mappings in Supabase for reuse.

Impact:

Reduces manual mapping from hours to minutes.

80 %+ of new directories can now be processed automatically.

5. ü™Ñ DescriptionCustomizer

Role: Content optimization for submission forms.
Trigger: Pre-fill step for each directory.
Responsibilities:

Tailor business description to directory‚Äôs language and tone.

Insert keywords known to increase approval rates.

Use A/B testing framework to improve over time.

Example:
Generic ‚Üí ‚ÄúDirectoryBolt is an AI-powered automation platform.‚Äù
ProductHunt-tailored ‚Üí ‚ÄúDirectoryBolt helps startups boost visibility across 800+ platforms with AI-powered directory submissions.‚Äù

6. ‚è∞ SubmissionTimingOptimizer

Role: Time-aware decision agent.
Trigger: Before each directory submission.
Responsibilities:

Analyze approval rate patterns by directory and timezone.

Recommend best submission window.

Delay or log if suboptimal.

Benefit:

+15 % average approval improvement.

7. üîÅ IntelligentRetryAnalyzer

Role: AI-based failure analysis and retry planning.
Trigger: On failed submission.
Responsibilities:

Parse failure messages.

Classify failure: content, policy, technical, temporary.

Calculate retry probability and suggest improvements.

Schedule smart retry (vs. brute force).

Retry categories:
CONTENT_QUALITY | REQUIREMENTS_NOT_MET | WRONG_CATEGORY | TECHNICAL_ERROR | TEMPORARY_REJECTION | POLICY_VIOLATION

8. üìà PerformanceFeedbackLoop

Role: Continuous learning layer.
Trigger: After every submission.
Responsibilities:

Log submission metadata (AI score, mapping, timing, status).

Update success/failure models.

Improve future probability estimates and content strategies.

Provide analytics to the dashboard and AI scoring.

9. üß™ ABTestingFramework

Role: Optimize tactics through controlled variation.
Trigger: Randomized per submission.
Responsibilities:

Compare different wording, timing, form-fill strategies.

Store performance data for model improvement.

üß† Additional Agents & Utility Layers

üóÇÔ∏è Data Flow with AI Agents
1. Job created in Supabase
2. QueueManager selects optimal job
3. Orchestrator loads and sorts directories
4. For each directory:
   - WorkerAgent computes AI score
   - TimingOptimizer runs
   - DescriptionCustomizer runs
   - AIFormMapper runs (if needed)
   - Submission executed
   - Result classified (submitted / failed / skipped)
   - RetryAnalyzer may trigger
   - FeedbackLoop records data
5. Job completes
6. Dashboard + database updated in real-time

üßæ Example Job Lifecycle
Step	Agent	Action	Output
1	AIEnhancedQueueManager	Select highest probability job	job #2025-10-22
2	SubmissionOrchestratorAgent	Load 50 directories, filter	42 processable
3	AIEnhancedWorkerAgent	Loop over directories	Submission results
4	AIFormMapper	Auto-detect selectors	Mapping confidence 0.87
5	DescriptionCustomizer	Tailor copy	Approval boost
6	TimingOptimizer	Check optimal window	Proceed
7	Playwright/Gemini	Submit form	Result: submitted
8	FeedbackLoop	Log + learn	Model updated
‚ö° Technical Integration Points

API endpoints exposed via Netlify functions

/api/autobolt/jobs/update

/api/autobolt/jobs/complete

Database powered by Supabase (jobs, job_results, autobolt_submission_logs).

Workers run in Docker containers with Playwright.

Metrics exposed to Prometheus for scaling logic.

üß≠ Agent State & Monitoring

Each agent logs:

Decision timestamp

Confidence score

Selected strategy (e.g., Playwright vs Gemini)

Result classification

Processing time

Monitoring dashboards display:

Active jobs

Queue health

Success vs. failure trends

Mapping confidence distribution

AI vs. manual ratios over time

üöÄ Roadmap for Agent Evolution

 Advanced multi-agent collaboration (parallelized submissions with dynamic backoff)

 Real-time AI scoring model fine-tuning from live job logs

 Feedback loop integration with reinforcement learning agent

 More granular retry strategies (content-specific variants)

 Predictive resource scaling based on queue load + AI probability

‚úÖ In short: DirectoryBolt‚Äôs new AI-Enhanced Agent Architecture replaces a static pipeline with a probability-driven, self-optimizing submission engine, cutting submission time in half and boosting success rates by 40 %+.
