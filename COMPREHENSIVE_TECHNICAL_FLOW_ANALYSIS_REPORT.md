## 6. Performance Optimization Recommendations

### 6.1 Database Optimization Strategy

```sql
-- Recommended Index Optimizations
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_customers_processing_status 
ON customers(subscription_tier, subscription_status, created_at) 
WHERE subscription_status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_jobs_queue_priority 
ON jobs(status, priority_level, created_at) 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- Partition large tables for better performance
CREATE TABLE jobs_archive (LIKE jobs INCLUDING ALL);
-- Implement monthly partitioning for job history
```

### 6.2 API Performance Improvements

```typescript
// Implement Redis caching for AI analysis
const cacheKey = `analysis:${businessData.website}:${analysisType}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

// Queue-based processing for heavy operations
await queueManager.addJob('ai-analysis', {
  customerId,
  analysisType: 'comprehensive',
  priority: tierPriority[customer.tier]
});
```

### 6.3 Real-time Updates Architecture

```typescript
// WebSocket implementation for live updates
const wsManager = new WebSocketManager();
wsManager.subscribe(`customer:${customerId}:progress`, (update) => {
  // Real-time progress updates to customer dashboard
});

// Server-sent events for staff dashboard
app.get('/api/staff/events', (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive'
  });
  // Stream real-time staff updates
});
```

---

## 7. Security Enhancement Recommendations

### 7.1 API Security Hardening

```typescript
// Implement rate limiting per customer tier
const rateLimits = {
  starter: { requests: 100, window: '1h' },
  growth: { requests: 500, window: '1h' },
  professional: { requests: 1000, window: '1h' },
  enterprise: { requests: 5000, window: '1h' }
};

// API key rotation mechanism
const rotateApiKey = async (customerId: string) => {
  const newKey = generateSecureKey();
  await updateApiKey(customerId, newKey);
  await scheduleOldKeyExpiry(7); // 7-day grace period
};
```

### 7.2 Data Protection Enhancements

```typescript
// Field-level encryption for sensitive business data
const encryptBusinessData = (data: BusinessData) => {
  const sensitive = ['phone', 'address', 'financial_info'];
  return {
    ...data,
    ...sensitive.reduce((encrypted, field) => ({
      ...encrypted,
      [field]: encrypt(data[field], getEncryptionKey())
    }), {})
  };
};
```
