# DirectoryBolt SEO Implementation Roadmap
*Atlas - World-Renowned SEO Specialist*

## üöÄ Week 1: Critical Foundation Fixes

### Day 1-2: Homepage Repositioning
**Current State Analysis:**
- Title: "Directory Submission Service | AI-Powered Business Listings"
- Focus: Directory submissions (commodity positioning)
- Missing: Premium business intelligence value proposition

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Update Homepage Title & Meta Description**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<title>Directory Submission Service | AI-Powered Business Listings | DirectoryBolt</title>
<meta name="description" content="Get listed on 500+ high-authority directories with our AI-powered directory submission service..." />

<!-- AFTER -->
<title>AI Business Intelligence Platform | $4,300 Value for $299 | DirectoryBolt</title>
<meta name="description" content="Get $4,300 worth of AI business intelligence for $299. Competitive analysis, market research, and strategic insights that typically cost $2,000-5,000 from consultants. 93% savings guaranteed." />
```

2. **Update Schema Markup**
```json
{
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "DirectoryBolt AI Business Intelligence Platform",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "description": "AI-powered business intelligence platform delivering $4,300 worth of competitive analysis, market research, and strategic insights for $299",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "299",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "description": "$4,300 worth of business intelligence for $299 - 93% savings vs traditional consultants"
  }
}
```

### Day 3-4: Pricing Page Optimization

**Current Issues:**
- Focuses on directory submission pricing
- Missing value comparison vs consultants
- No ROI calculator or savings emphasis

**Implementation:**

1. **Add Value Comparison Section**
```jsx
// Add to pricing page
<section className="py-20 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4">
    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-12">
      Why Pay $4,300 to Consultants When You Can Get the Same for $299?
    </h2>
    <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12">
      <div className="bg-red-50 border-2 border-red-200 rounded-xl p-8">
