## Build failure investigation (validator types)
- Netlify build logs show TypeScript error: cannot find type definition file for 'validator' while running 
ext build.
- 	sconfig.json lists 'validator' in compilerOptions.types, so TypeScript expects a global typings package.
- Local package.json currently includes both alidator (runtime dep) and @types/validator (devDependency). Netlify's production install may exclude devDependencies, causing missing type definitions during build.
- Removing 'validator' from tsconfig or moving @types/validator to runtime dependencies should resolve the CI failure.
